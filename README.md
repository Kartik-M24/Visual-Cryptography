Image Encryption and Decryption

**Description:**
It starts by generating a key using the generate pattern function. This pattern image is then converted to greyscale and embeded within a colour image.
The plain image is then encrypted using the key image.
Finally the cipher image and key image can be extracted via ExtractImage before being decrytped via DecryptImage
